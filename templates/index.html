  <h2>History & Origin</h2>
  <p>
    Wine has been a symbol of culture, tradition, and celebration for over 8,000 years. 
    It originated in the country of Georgia, where the earliest evidence of wine-making was found. 
    From the ancient Greeks and Romans to today's AI-powered wine recommendations, 
    the journey of wine is rich and evolving.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modern wine classification uses factors like grape variety, region, aroma, alcohol content, and acidity. 
    With data science, we can now classify wines with precision and even suggest perfect pairings.
